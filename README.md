# episode-calendar
An iOS app to display a schedule of TV episodes. 

The iPhone version of this app displays a list of TV shows on each day, from newest to oldest.

The iPad version displays the same data but in a calendar month view instead of a list.

When you select an epsidode, you can view a list of all the episodes from the season that the selected episode was in.
